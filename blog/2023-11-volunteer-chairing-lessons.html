              This guide contains insights and practical advice from running SPLASH'23 in Cascais as a Volunteer Co-Chair. I learned most of the steps from Hanneli Tavante (thank you!), and added my own reflections on what worked well and what could be improved.

            <h3>Detailed Guide</h3>

            <h3>Before the Conference</h3>

            <p>
              It's always a good idea to ask for suggestions/impressions from previous chairs of the same conference to avoid falling into similar issues.
            </p>

            <h4>Applications</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Plan the application period and documents applicants have to fill out (usually a Google form, sometimes ask for a letter from the advisors)</li>
              <li>After deciding on a timeline, confirm with the GC and CM if the timeline is reasonable.</li>
              <li>This time (SPLASH'23), we did the following: open a single round of applications and have it open for 1 month, starting 4 months before the beginning of the conference.</li>
              <li>Check if you will have virtual volunteers!</li>
              <li>Populate the website with information about the duties and responsibilities (usually the same as past versions of the conference).</li>
              <li>Be general with the tasks since some specific parts might change between conferences.</li>
              <li>Write clearly what is covered for volunteers (usually registration and access to social events). Even if it is obvious on the website, volunteers will still ask.</li>
              <li>Once the application is open, share it online to reach as many applicants as possible. Work with the publicity team in the organization. Usually, it is good to share the news over Twitter and popular mailing lists and send emails/messages within the organizations of the OC team.</li>
              <li>Contact the GC and CM to see how many volunteers you can have. The number usually depends on the number of paying attendees at the conference.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>For SPLASH'23:</strong> We had 50 volunteers for 700 attendees, 5 days of the conference, with one of them with 11 parallel tracks.
            </p>

            <h4>Accepting Volunteers</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Define metrics to accept/decline applicants (usually, it is good to have a mix of senior and junior volunteers).</li>
              <li>Try to accept more volunteers than what you need. There are usually many cancellations (not attending the conference anymore, VISA issues, last-minute health issues, etc.). For SPLASH'23, we had around 10 cancelations.</li>
              <li>See if it is possible to have Volunteer t-shirts (or jackets, or others) so that the attendees will quickly identify the volunteers during their shifts. Talk with GC and CM.</li>
              <li>Send acceptance notifications and ask for confirmation (ask for t-shirt sizes in the confirmation form).</li>
              <li>Even after confirmation, people will probably cancel due to last-minute issues.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Information Before the Conference</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Send registration codes and steps for registration (step-by-step instructions are usually a good idea)</li>
              <li>Some people might have already registered; ask the GC and CM if they should register again with the Volunteer code.</li>
              <li>Create the Volunteer Guide as a WIP.</li>
              <li>It is good to create the Volunteer guide as soon as possible while mentioning that it is a work in progress. Some things will be similar to previous years, but many things might change depending on the venue, GC, video-audio team, etc.</li>
              <li>Coordinate with the GC and CM on the volunteers' needs besides helping during the talk sessions. For example, ask if they need help with lunches, social events, poster sessions, etc.</li>
              <li>Include the times when volunteers should be ready to work - usually 15mins at the beginning of the shift and 7-10 mins before each session starts after breaks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Create the Schedule</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Create the schedule with the slots based on volunteer needs, and decide what slots a volunteer should choose.</li>
              <li>Make sure that the conference schedule is finalized! Or will only require very small changes. Talk with OC.</li>
              <li>In SPLASH'23, we had two types of volunteers - Support Volunteers and AV (audio visual) Volunteer - the rules were slightly different for each group.</li>
              <li>We used Google Sheets, with one day in each sheet. The schedule included presentation sessions, lunches, floating roles, conf preparation (day before conf), and conf tear-down (last day of conf, after the last talk). For AV volunteers, we also included training sessions.</li>
              <li>Usually, workshop days are the busiest ones since there are many parallel tracks - try to fill these first and the main conference days later. We did this by giving different colors to these slots and making it mandatory to choose one of them.</li>
              <li>Have "floater" slots in parallel to other slots. Floaters are usually volunteers who have no pre-determined duty but are on call for any last-minute needs.</li>
              <li>Create a group for communication (e.g., discord, slack, etc.)</li>
              <li>If the conference is already using a platform, use the same. If the conference is not using anything, create your own group/workspace - it will be essential during the conference days.</li>
              <li>Send the schedule for volunteers to choose their slots, specifying the rules to choose slots, and give the link to enter the communication group. Set a deadline for choosing slots (1 or 2 weeks before the conference).</li>
              <li>At SPLASH'23, we gave instructions to choose 1 green slot (all-day workshop), 2 blue slots (half-day workshops or half-day duty in the main conference or lunch slots), and 1 orange slot (floating for half-a-day).</li>
              <li>Sometimes, you will need to rearrange the slots.</li>
              <li>Let volunteers choose v.s. chairs choosing for them - there are pros and cons, but usually, volunteers will be happier and less prone to change the schedule if they choose, and the scheduling work is less for chairs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Community Building</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>In the communication group, start a conversation - it should feel like a safe and active space for everyone to share. The chairs should introduce themselves and ask the volunteers to introduce themselves.</li>
              <li>Close to the deadline, check if everyone has filled the slots correctly. If not, send emails.</li>
              <li>If you are at the conference site before the day or know some volunteers who will be, it can be nice to join everyone for an informal chill drink/dinner to get to know each other.</li>
              <li>Create a place for volunteers to put the number of attendees of the sessions during the conference.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>During the Conference</h3>

            <h4>Welcome Volunteers</h4>
            <p>
              It can be nice to have a welcome for everyone on the first morning of the conference. However, people might not be at the conference yet. An option is to do a welcome on the first day of the conference and another on the first day of the main track.
            </p>
            <p>
              We did not do this in SPLASH'23, but I now think it would have been a good idea so that everyone could get to know the chairs and each other.
            </p>

            <h4>Volunteer Dinner</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Check if there is budget for a Volunteer Dinner and schedule it.</li>
              <li>Usually, we only know if there is a budget at the start of the conference - check with GC and CM.</li>
              <li>Try to schedule the dinner for a day compatible with the other social events (e.g., not in the reception, Women@Conf dinner, etc.), and usually, the last day is not a good idea since many people will be gone.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Volunteer Hub</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Have a Volunteer Hub - usually just the registration desk - as a place where volunteers can always find help.</li>
              <li>During the sessions, one chair should stay in the hub while another should check if the sessions are going as planned (e.g., volunteers are in place, there is a need for help). Always pay attention to the communication group where "fires" will appear. Make sure that volunteers are paying attention to it as well and feel welcome to share their problems there.</li>
              <li>Have the volunteer dinner and take pictures during it. It is also possible to arrange a special time for a volunteer group photo, but some people might be busy with other tasks.</li>
            </ul>

            <blockquote class="blog-quote">
              The schedules for volunteer chairs will usually be busy - each day, arrive before the conference starts, stay until after it finishes, plus social events. So, try to sleep well before, during, and after.
            </blockquote>

            <h3>After the Conference</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>At the end of the conference, remember to thank everyone over the communication channel and on the conference's social media (e.g., use photos of dinner).</li>
              <li>Send a feedback form to the volunteers to see what can be improved.</li>
              <li>Send the number of attendees at each session to the GC so they can share it with the OC.</li>
            </ul>
